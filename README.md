### python topic: customer order behavior
The project encompasses data from an online food delivery service operating in the United States. The data included product and customer information, intended to reveal specific ordering patterns. It was crucial to extract insights from the data to assist the marketing team in developing strategies to boost sales. Multiple dataframes were merged, cleaned, and new variables were created using techniques such as if-statements and for-loops, aiming to provide better insights into consumer purchasing behavior.


The uploaded files contain various codes to retrieve insights from the customer data.
